# SignIn SignUp Animation

This project was developed as part of the final project of Flag's Frontend Developer course, in which I obtained a grade of 16. A responsive login interface that goes up to a main menu page with 4 buttons. Throughout the interface, which was designed and thought up by me, I tried to make the most of css and js animations and play around with it, since it was just an academic experiment. All the icons were designed by me in adobe illustrator and so it results in a unique and exclusive interface full of creativity that identifies me so much.
