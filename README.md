# Academic_project_myclo
 
 Project carried out at the end of the front-end developer course. Application developed by me. It is a virtual "closet" that aims to store clothes and accessories (photos) by season (Spring / Summer / Autumn / Winter), by types of clothes (pants, coat...), by color. ..per household. The user creates the sections that make the most sense for him in organizing his closet. This way we avoid "forgetting parts".
